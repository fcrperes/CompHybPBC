# Circuit compilation and hybrid computation using Pauli-based computation

In this repository we can find the Python code used to produce the results
presented in our paper [https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2023-10-03-1126/].

This code uses different modules, each equipped with different classes, methods
and functions to make things more readable and user friendly.
Each module is suitably documented at the start for clarity. In principle,
users need only open and make changes to `Main.py`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Prerequisites:** This code was written using the following versions:
* Python 3.7.10;
* numpy 1.20.1;
* matplotlib 3.3.4;
* 'qiskit-terra': '0.17.4', 'qiskit-aer': '0.8.2', 'qiskit-ignis': '0.6.0',
'qiskit-ibmq-provider': '0.13.1', 'qiskit-aqua': '0.9.1', 'qiskit': '0.26.2',
'qiskit-nature': None, 'qiskit-finance': None, 'qiskit-optimization': None,
'qiskit-machine-learning': None


**Brief description:** The modules supplied allow us to execute two different
tasks (as described in our paper
[https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2023-10-03-1126/]):
* Task 1: Efficient circuit compilation and weak simulation; to carry out this
task one should open the `Main.py` module, change the number of virtual qubits,
`vq`, to 0 and adjust the parameters of the function `cc.run_pbc` as desired;
* Task 2: Hybrid computation using virtual qubits and approximate strong simu-
lation with maximum relative error Ïµ; to perform this task one should open the
`Main.py` module, change the number of virtual qubits, `vq`, to a number greater
than 0, and adjust the parameters of the function `cc.hybrid_pbc` as desired.

 
**Use instructions**:
1. Make sure that the four Python modules (`Main.py`, `input_prep_t1.py`,
`input_prep_t2.py`, and `c_and_c.py`) are all in the same directory in your
computer;
2. Copy the input (.qasm) toy files supplied in this repository into a folder
in your computer (or make your own files with suitable Clifford+T quantum
circuits);
3. The files output by the code will be saved to a folder named "output" which
will be found inside the folder where you have placed the input file or files;
4. In the `Main.py` file change the location of the input files to point to the
correct location in your computer; change also the name of the input file(s)
appropriately, and choose the desired name for the different output files.
Adjust the parameters of `cc.run_pbc` or `cc.hybrid_pbc` depending on the
simulation you want to run;
5. Open a terminal window in the directory where you have placed the Python
modules and run the command: `python Main.py`;
6. Check the output files at the location that you have selected.


**Tracking code versions**:
1. First commit: the original version of the code;
2. Second commit: no changes to the original code, simple inclusion of the
e-print no. in this file and in the string documentation of the python files;
3. Third commit: an improvement was made to the sampling complexity of the
hybrid computation task (the theoretical explanation of this improvement can be
seen in the final version of our article);
4. Fourth commit: an improvement was made in the algorithm for assessing the
(in)dependence of the Paulis; this lead to an improvement of the overall
complexity of our code as seen in the new version of our article.
5. Fifth commit: included the greedy algorithm proposed in our new preprint
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04007].
